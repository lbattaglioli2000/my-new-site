        text: "The week before I started college, I grabbed a coffee with a new friend of mine and we chatted it up for a couple hours. We explored many different tangents throughout our conversation. One of the first things that came up pretty quickly was college. My friend made his position on college and higher education pretty clear... that being he isn't a huge fan of it. After enduring my first couple weeks of classes, I myself have been struggling to justify why I'm even going in the first place.\_"

I love writing and want to become the best writer that I possibly can be, and I think that this class could actually help me get one step closer to that goal. So far, this is the only course that I can actually justify taking.'

        text: 'After English, my next class is college algebra and trigonometry. I have to take this solely because of the fact that I did real crappy in Geometry when I was in high school, and in order for me to transfer into the computer science track at my school, I need to pass this math class. So, here we are. My professor, Theresa, seems pretty nice and also seems to have a pretty good sense of humor too which kind of makes the class tolerable. That being said, hopefully the class won''t be too bad! I had really bad math teachers throughout high school and for once in my life, the information is actually clicking with my brain which is good I suppose.'

        text: "After my math class, I have Programming and Logic I. I think my professor is the type of professor who knows every little minute detail there is to know about Java, but has absolutely no idea how to convey his understanding of the subject to other people. Nobody in the class knows what's going on, and they're all struggling to understand the material. I think that this is exactly what's wrong with computer science education, and why there's a lack of people (especially women and minorities) pursuing this area. You tend to have crappy professors who just throw technical jargon like the \"input memory buffer\" at you on day one, and just expect you to know what the hell they're talking about. I think that the sophisticated and complex manor it's presented to you as a student discourages you from learning it, because it seems so complex and overwhelming. When people teach computer science courses like my professor, they actively instill a\_"

I myself have wanted to smash my head on my keyboard every day so far this semester because this course is so elementary for me. I've been writing Java for the past 3 years, and am well beyond the level of this course. The professor is so monotone too and it makes me dread the class even more. My biggest complaint about him however, is that whenever he grades our work, the feedback he leaves us incoherent nonsense. For one assignment he gave us, I had to write a program to calculate and print the ending balance of what they a user owed on their chargecard, as well as if they are at, over, or below their credit limit. After submitting it, this is what I got back, copied and pasted verbatim from Blackboard:"

        text: 'The last class is have is my college forum class. I think this is the weirdest class I''m taking. On the first day of class, when I walked in, there was a bunch of people already sitting and waiting for the professor to show up. Exactly at 2:00, this man stood up from the back of the room, went over to the door, slammed it shut, and shuffled through his papers in the front of the room for a bit before he said anything. He reminded me of a very hostile Robin Williams. His face was really red and he looked a little over heated. He tends to stand directly in front of the projector screen, and it always blinds him and he''s constantly squinting to see us all. I don''t actually know what the purpose of the class is, or why I''m taking it for that matter. I think it''s just to introduce us all to college life, but we have no work to do other than show up for the class.'

If I''m being honest with myself, I don''t really want to keep going to school. I don''t see any value in it anymore. Over the years, starting in 6th grade, I''ve studied hard by myself and learned a lot. I''ve built up a skill set of (what I think is) relevant skills and I think that I could find (or start) something that pays the bills. Why do I need to dig myself a deep financial hole, to get a formal college education, that doesn''t even teach me relevant skills.'
